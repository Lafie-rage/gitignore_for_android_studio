# Gitingore for Android Studio/Idea project
A simple gitignore for Android Studio and Idea project

## Disclaimer
This gitignore is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY, without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the applicable licenses for more details.

## Sources
This gitingore is based on my own experience as Android developer and multiple other gitignore proposed by other developer on Github/StackOverFlow. It's also based on the default gitignore provided by Android Studio itself while creating a new projet.

The goal was only to simplify it by removing unecessary lines for my purposes.
